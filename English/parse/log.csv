perlu diketatkan Masa penjualan arak dan lokasi minum arak perlu dikaji Kawasan tempat awam seperti di taman awam dan taman permainan kanak-kanak minum arak wajib diharamkan Dewan ini juga wajib mempertimbangkan penubuhan Pusat Pemulihan Arak (PPA) di setiap negeri di Malaysia untuk membendung masalah minum arak yang semakin berleluasa di kalangan anak muda merentasi sempadan bangsa dan agama.” Menteri Dalam Negeri PR-1343-U77438 akan mencadangkan “Bahawa Dewan ini mempertimbangkan cadangan untuk kes kematian di bawah tahanan Polis DiRaja Malaysia keluarga simati diberi kebenaran sepenuhnya untuk memperoleh Pakar Perubatan Forensik sendiri bagi mewakili pihak keluarga si mati semasa bedah siasat dijalankan.” Menteri Dalam Negeri PR-1343-U77439 akan mencadangkan “Bahawa Dewan ini mendesak agar pendidikan agama diperkenalkan di sekolah kepada pelajar bukan Islam sebagai langkah untuk menerapkan nilai–nilai murni dan keagamaan di kalangan pelajar bukan Islam bagi menangani gegala sosial yang kian meningkat dan berleluasa akibat daripada kegagalan sistem pendidikan di Malaysia.” Menteri Pendidikan AUM DR akan mencadangkan Pada 17.10.2016 Yang Di-Pertua telahpun membuat keputusan di dalam Dewan Rakyat seperti berikut Jadi masa tidak lagi mengizinkan Jadi sesi pertanyaan-pertanyaan bagi jawapan lisan berakhir dan sebelum saya memanggil Setiausaha untuk beredar ke urusan mesyuarat yang lain ada satu perkara mustahak yang ingin saya umumkan iaitu Ahli-ahli Yang Berhormat saya mendapati beberapa soalan dalam pertanyaan jawapan lisan dan bertulis serta usul yang telah dikemukakan bagi Mesyuarat Ketiga Penggal Keempat Parlimen Ketiga Belas kali ini berkaitan dengan satu isu yang menjadi kegemaran ahli-ahli Yang Berhormat iaitu isu tindakan sivil rem oleh Jabatan Keadilan Amerikat Syarikat atau singkat DOJ Jadi untuk mengelakkan lagi satu pertuduhan seperti di sesi yang lalu iaitu di mana soalan yang perlu dijawab secara lisan oleh kerana tidak ada masa untuk dijawab pada ketika itu maka Menteri menjawab mengatakan bahawa tidak payalah dijawab secara bertulis oleh kerana itu adalah sub judice Jadi dalam hal ini dalam sesi ini juga ada perkara-perkara yang sedemikian Jadi saya tidak mahu lagi timbul satu persepsi di mana Menteri akan dituduh bahawa dia assumed role Speaker Jadi untuk itu setelah meneliti isi kandungan pertanyaan-pertanyaan tersebut saya mendapati bahawa ia adalah perkara yang masih dalam timbangan mahkamah ataupun sub judice Oleh itu Menteri yang berkenaan tidak perlu jawab kepada perkara-perkara tersebut Manakala kepada Ahli-ahli Yang Berhormat yang sedemikian untuk memuaskan hati mereka saya akan sampaikan setiap Ahli Yang Berhormat keputusan saya secara bertulis Terima kasih Sila Dengan hormatnya saya usulkan supaya keputusan Yang Di-Pertua tersebut dikaji semula menurut Peraturan Peraturan Majlis Mesyuarat di atas alasan-alasan berikut Peraturan yang menghalang pertanyaan oleh kerana sub judice tidak terpakai kepada kes-kes di luar Malaysia (ii) Oleh yang demikian tindakan sivil rem oleh Jabatan Keadilan Amerika Syarikat tidak boleh menjadi asas untuk penolakan soalan ataupun seseorang Menteri dikecualikan daripada menjawab soalan tersebut atas alasan perkara itu sub judis (iii) Perkara ini dibincangkan dalam ”Buku Erskine May Treaties The Law Privileges Proceeding Usage Parliament 24th Edition 2011” di mana 365 dimukasurat disebut seperti berikut AUM DR Matters sub judice By resolution House cases proceedings active United Kingdom courts shall referred motion debate question (see pp 396 441-443) House resolved Chair discretion allow reference matters awaiting jurisdiction civil courts certain specified circumstances provided real substantial danger prejudice proceedings The ‘sub judice rule' called applied matters coroner court Fatal Accident Inquiry If subject-matter question sub judice questions given Member asked withdraw Speaker direct removed notice paper refuse allow asked Order Paper The rule does apply matters sub judice courts law outside Great Britain Northern Island matters subject administrative inquiry (iv) jadi dengan segala hormatnya jelas bahawa keputusan Speaker yang berasaskan kepada alasan sub judice adalah bertentangan dengan praktis yang diamalkan berkenaan isu itu dan oleh yang sedemikian boleh dan perlu dikaji semula Seterusnya dengan merujuk kembali lagi kepada petikan di dalam buku Erskine May di atas adalah jelas bahawa sekiranya pun prosiding tersebut di dalam negara ini Speaker dalam memutuskan isu sama ada ataupun tidak perkara ini dihalang kerana sub judice perlu menilaikan sama ada wujud ataupun tidak “real substantial danger prejudice” kepada prosiding tersebut Dengan segala hormatnya untuk menimbang dan seterusnya membuat keputusan berkenaan perkara itu saya berpendapat bahawa Speaker perlu memberikan Ahli-ahli Parlimen peluang untuk didengar sebelum membuat sebarang keputusan berkenaannya menyakinkan diri dengan rujukan penuh kepada prosiding Mahkamah tersebut dan seterusnya menimbangkan kesan soalan-soalan yang ditanya kepada prosiding tersebut sebelum membuat keputusan tersebut Di dalam hal ini saya memohon supaya Speaker menjelaskan (ii) tidak Speaker ada salinan dan sudah sama ada ataupun menimbangkan dengan mendalam semua kertas-kertas kuasa dalam prosiding DOJ tersebut (iaitu tuntutan dan jawapan-jawapan kepadanya sekiranya ad untuk menyakinkan diri Speaker berkenaan fakta-fakta serta isu-isu yang berbangkit dalam perkara itu untuk membuat keputusan bahawa soalan-soalan itu adalah dihalang oleh perkara sub judice AUM DR seterusnya saya dengan segala hormatnya memohon rujuk kepada Peraturan 36(1) dan 23(1) Peraturan Mesyuarat Dewan Rakyat di mana cukup jelas bahawa perkara yang perlu diputuskan adalah 23(1) A question shall drafted likely prejudice case trial asked matter sub judice dan 36(2) Reference shall matter sub judice way opinion chair prejudice interests parties thereto” (ii) Dengan segala hormatnya menurut Peraturan tersebut Speaker perlu untuk menentusahkan “parties” kepada tindakan ini dan kepentingan mereka sebelum keputusan berkenaan prejudis yang mungkin timbul seakibat soalan yang diajukan itu Speaker Negara kami dilanda krisis dan segi wujudnya satu perkara yang melibatkan wang yang sangat besar yang kini menjadi topik perbincangan hangat bukan sahaja di Malaysia tetapi di seluruh dunia Perkara ini telahpun menyebabkan tindakan yang tegas diambil oleh negara-negara seperti Singapura United Kingdom dan Amerika Syarikat manakala di negara kita tiada sebarang tindakan berkesan diambil terhadap mana-mana pihak sama sekali sehingga sekarang Perkara ini telahpun menyebabkan banyak soalan ditanya oleh rakyat Malaysia khususnya berkenaan corak pentadbiran Kerajaan kami dan pengendalian siasatan perkara ini oleh jabatan-jabatan seperti Jabatan Peguam Negara PDRM dan SPRM Isu ini sudah semestinya menjadi satu isu berkepentingan awam dan amat sangat perlu dibahaskan di dalam Dewan Rakyat Keputusan Speaker dengan segala hormatnya mempunyai kesan penghalang perkara ini daripada dibahaskan secara transparen dan juga memprejudiskan kesemua pihak dengan amat sangat oleh kerana mereka kehilangan peluang untuk menyoal dan menjelaskan semua keraguan yang timbul di dalam Dewan Rakyat yang mulia ini untuk pengetahuan rakyat Malaysia secara keseluruhannya Saya juga merayu kepada Speaker supaya melihat kepada “precedent” yang akan dicapai melalui keputusan ini di mana daripada sekarang mudah sekali untuk sesiapa menghalang sesuatu perkara itu dibangkitkan di Dewan Rakyat iaitu dengan memfailkan atau merujuk kepada prosiding di luar negara untuk tujuan itu AUM DR Ini kepada saya bukan niat ataupun matlamat yang ingin dicapai oleh Peraturan Mesyuarat yang digubal untuk “enhance” dan bukannya “restrict” dengan izin perbahasan perkara-perkara penting untuk negara kita di dalam Dewan Rakyat yang mulia ini Maka saya selaku Ahli Parlimen merayu supaya usul saya dibenarkan dibahas dan keputusan Speaker itu dikaji semula dan diketepikan dengan serta merta Perdana Menteri AUM DR
